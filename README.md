Pico 8 BBS cart webscraper - for those who like retro-style fantasy-console gaming

# Get started
Install:
<ul>
  <li>Python â‰¥ <b>3.12</b>
  <li>Python package <code>beautifulsoup4</code>, installed via <code>pip install beautifulsoup4</code></li>
</ul>

To run <code>pico8bb.py</code>, call

```
python pico8bb.py ...
```

or, if you set <code>.py</code> files to open with Python by default, call

```
pico8bb.py ...
```

or, even better, if also you add `.PY` to environment variable PATHEXT (Windows only), call

```
pico8bb ...
```

The script can be run straight away without arguments but there are options to customize its behaviour. For help, call the script with option <code>-h</code> like so.

```
pico8bb -h
```
